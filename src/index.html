    <p>
        This yearâ€™s midterms will reveal where Americans stand on abortion after the U.S. 
        Supreme Court in June handed states the power to decide its legality.
        <span>Competitive races</span> and <span>ballot measures</span> could change what abortion access 
        looks like after the Nov. 8 elections.
